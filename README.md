**Final thoughts?**

Well organized project.

Recommendations/Notes:

1. Organize Css files into BEM structure after the whole page is complete for one screen size.
2. Have media query sizes in order, from largest to smallest, so values dont overlap.
3. Media queries are organized according to the classes with similar css files.
